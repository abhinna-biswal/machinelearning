Project Machine Learning using Tensorflow 

Here is developed a Machine Learning Tool using Tensorflow and Keras. TensorFlow is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks available. It's used for everything from cutting-edge machine learning research to building new features for the hottest start-ups in Silicon Valley. In this project, learn how to use Tensorflow to build a simple deep learning model. After demonstrating deep learning model building, it shows how to create and train a machine learning model, as well as how to leverage visualization tools to analyze and improve your model. Finally, this project explains how to deploy models locally or in the cloud. When you wrap up this project, you'll be ready to start building and deploying your own models with TensorFlow.
